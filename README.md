# deep-learning-challenge

The Charity Funding Predictor project was set out with an ambitious goal: to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict the success of grant applications to the fictional nonprofit organization, Alphabet Soup. Starting with the data preprocessing phase, we meticulously cleaned the dataset, stripping away unnecessary columns and diving into the world of categorical features. We encountered a variety of categorical values and decided to lump the less frequent ones into a catch-all "Other" category. Then, with the magic of one-hot encoding, we transformed these categories into a numerical format that our models could understand. The dataset was neatly divided into features and a target array, dubbed IS_SUCCESSFUL, and underwent standardization to ensure fairness in model training.

Despite throwing a mix of neural network architectures into the ring, including variations from two to four layers and experimenting with different neurons and activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid, we hit a snag. Across three earnest attempts, our best shot landed us at a 72.75% accuracy rateâ€”shy of our 75% goal. Each attempt was a learning curve, starting from a simpler two-layer setup to a more complex four-layer structure, hoping to inch closer to our accuracy target with each iteration.

In the end, while we didn't crack the 75% accuracy ceiling, the journey wasn't without its merits. The project underscored the importance of flexibility in model selection and the willingness to explore beyond the beaten path. It seems we're back to the drawing board, ready to sift through alternative classification models that might just be the key to predicting the success of Alphabet Soup's funding applications with greater precision.
